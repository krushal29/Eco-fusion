          <h2 id="wind-intro">1. Introduction</h2>
          <p id="wind-intro-p">Wind energy is the kinetic energy of moving air, caused by unequal heating of Earth’s surface by the Sun and the planet's rotation. Wind turbines convert this kinetic energy into mechanical and then electrical energy.</p>
          <p>Renewable, abundant, and clean — one of the fastest-growing energy sources worldwide.</p>

          <h2 id="wind-site">2. Site Selection Criteria</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Average wind speed ≥ 12–16 km/h.</li>

            <li>Open plains, coastal areas, hilltops preferred; low turbulence and minimal obstacles.</li>
            <li>Strong soil/rock base for tower foundation and proximity to transmission lines.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Rotor blades, hub, main shaft, gearbox, generator, yaw system, pitch control, tower, controller & sensors.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="wind-classification">4. Classification of Wind Turbines</h2>
          <h3 id="wind-byaxis">4.1 By Axis</h3>
          <p>HAWTs (horizontal axis) — most common and efficient. VAWTs (vertical axis) — work in any wind direction and easier maintenance.</p>
          <h3>4.2 By Rotor Design</h3>
          <p>Savonius (low efficiency), Darrieus (higher efficiency), Multiblade (high torque for water pumping).</p>

          <h2 id="wind-working">5. Working of Wind Turbine</h2>
          <p>Wind strikes blades → rotor spins → shaft transfers motion → gearbox increases speed → generator produces electricity. Control systems manage loads during strong winds.</p>

          <h2 id="wind-applications">6. Applications of Wind Energy</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Grid-connected wind farms, mechanical uses (pumping), hybrid remote systems, offshore farms, micro turbines.</li>

          </ul>

          <section class="panel">
            <h1 id="wind-top">Wind Energy</h1>

            <h2 id="wind-intro">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Wind energy captures the kinetic power of moving air and turns it into
              electricity using turbine rotors connected to generators. Atmospheric
              temperature differences, driven primarily by the sun, create pressure
              gradients that drive wind; geographic features and the Earth's rotation
              further shape local wind patterns. Over the past decades, wind energy has
              matured into a reliable source of low-carbon electricity, with modern
              turbines optimized for high energy yield, durability and low maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both onshore and offshore wind have seen steep cost declines thanks to
              larger turbines, improved blades and economies of scale in manufacturing
              and installation. The technology is flexible: small turbines can power
              remote communities or provide mechanical energy (e.g., water pumping),
              while large-scale wind farms can supply grids with bulk power.
            </p>

            <h2 id="wind-site">2. Site Selection & Resource Assessment</h2>
            <p>
              Selecting a wind site begins with long-term wind resource measurements and
              modelling. Average wind speed, wind shear (how speed changes with height),
              turbulence intensity and extreme gust statistics determine expected energy
              yield and structural loads. Because power scales with the cube of wind
              speed, even modest improvements in average speed can greatly increase
              output. Offshore locations typically offer stronger and more consistent
              winds, which is why offshore projects are economically attractive despite
              higher installation costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other practical considerations include proximity to transmission, access
              for construction, environmental constraints and community acceptance. Modern
              resource assessment uses remote sensing (LIDAR, SODAR), mesoscale
              atmospheric models and long-term reanalysis datasets to estimate site
              viability before committing to construction.
            </p>

            <h2 id="wind-components">3. Turbine Technology & Components</h2>
            <p>
              A utility wind turbine consists of blades (designed for aeroelastic loads
              and efficiency), a hub, gearbox (in many designs), generator, nacelle and
              tower. Innovations include gearless (direct-drive) generators, lightweight
              composite blades, active pitch control for performance and yaw systems to
              orient turbines into the wind. Condition monitoring and predictive
              maintenance reduce downtime and lifecycle costs.
            </p>

            <h2 id="wind-working">4. How Wind Turbines Work</h2>
            <p>
              Wind passing over blades creates lift and drag; the lift component spins
              the rotor. The rotating shaft transfers power through a gearbox (if
              present) to a generator that produces electricity. Control systems adjust
              blade pitch and generator loading to optimize production and protect the
              turbine in high winds. Power electronics condition the generator output for
              grid compatibility and can provide grid support functions such as
              frequency response.
            </p>

            <h2 id="wind-applications">5. Applications & Integration</h2>
            <p>
              Wind energy is used for grid-scale generation, hybrid systems in remote
              locations, and smaller off-grid turbines. For grids with high wind shares,
              operational practices include improved forecasting, flexible resources
              (gas, hydro, storage) and demand response to balance variable output. Offshore
              wind systems are increasingly paired with large-scale storage and hydrogen
              production to utilize excess generation.
            </p>

            <h2 id="wind-case">6. Case Studies</h2>
            <p>
              India: States like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat led early deployment with onshore
              wind projects that leverage coastal and plain wind regimes. Recent policy
              efforts also focus on hybrid and offshore opportunities. Globally, projects
              such as Hornsea One in the UK demonstrate the scale achievable in offshore
              developments.
            </p>

            <h2 id="wind-future">7. Advantages, Challenges & Future Trends</h2>
            <p>
              Advantages include low operating emissions, job creation in manufacturing
              and construction, and rapid deployment cycles. Challenges include grid
              integration at high penetration, environmental siting concerns and the
              need for long-term supply chains for blades and towers. Future trends point
              to larger turbines, floating offshore platforms, improved recycling of
              composite blades, and digital tools for operations and maintenance.
