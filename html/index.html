					<h2>Energy</h2>
					<p>
						Energy is the fundamental capacity to do work — to move, heat, cool, transform
						and manufacture. For human societies, energy underpins nearly every activity:
						it powers homes and hospitals, transports goods and people, supports
						industry and agriculture, and runs the digital systems that connect modern
						commerce. Technically, energy exists in many forms (kinetic, potential, thermal,
						chemical and electrical) and is conserved while being converted between forms
						through engines, turbines and electrical machines.
					</p>
					<p>
						Beyond the physics, energy systems shape economies and environments. The type of
						energy a region uses — whether coal and oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, wind
						or solar — affects air quality, carbon emissions, employment patterns and
						infrastructure needs. Access to reliable, affordable energy is also a key
				
	driver of development: it enables education, healthcare, and small businesses to
						thrive.
					</p>
					<p>
						Contemporary energy planning focuses on three intertwined goals: security of
						supply (reliable availability), affordability (reasonable cost for consumers
						and industry), and sustainability (minimizing environmental and climate impacts).
						Meeting these goals requires not only deploying generation resources but also
						investing in networks, storage, efficiency measures and demand-side
						management. Technologies like smart meters, batteries and flexible market
						mechanisms let systems integrate variable renewables while preserving reliability.
					</p>
					<p>
						This site provides an accessible introduction to the technical concepts, policy
						choices and practical trade-offs involved in shifting to cleaner, more resilient
						energy systems, with an emphasis on solar and wind as scalable, cost-effective
						options for many regions.

				<section id="classification" class="panel">
					<h2>Classification of Energy Sources</h2>
					<p>
						Energy sources can be classified in multiple, complementary ways. These
						classifications help planners match technologies to needs and understand the
						implications for markets, infrastructure and policy.
					</p>
					<h3>Primary &amp; Secondary</h3>
					<p>
						Primary energy is found in nature: sunlight, wind, flowing water, biomass,
						coal, oil and natural gas. Secondary energy is the form we actually use after
						conversion — for example electricity produced from coal or solar panels, or
						refined fuels like gasoline. Converting primary to secondary energy involves
						losses and infrastructure; improving conversion efficiency is a major lever for
						reducing costs and emissions.
					</p>
					<h3>Commercial &amp; Non-commercial</h3>
					<p>
						Commercial energy is traded on markets and provided by utilities or fuel
						companies. Non-commercial energy includes locally collected resources used
						informally (e.g., firewood in rural households). Policies to improve energy
						access often focus on moving people from non-commercial to modern
						commercial energy services.
					</p>
					<h3>Renewable &amp; Non-renewable</h3>
					<p>
						Renewables are naturally replenished on human timescales — sunlight, wind,
						hydropower, geothermal heat and sustainably managed biomass. Non-renewable
						resources (coal, oil, gas) form over geological timescales and are finite;
						their combustion produces greenhouse gases that drive climate change.
					</p>
					<h3>Conventional &amp; Non-conventional</h3>
					<p>
						Historically, "conventional" referred to large, centralized thermal plants
						running on fossil fuels. "Non-conventional" (now commonly called
						"renewable") included distributed and variable technologies like solar and
						wind. The operational and investment decisions for each group differ, which
						is why the classification remains useful in planning discussions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each classification highlights different priorities — resource mapping and
						interconnection for renewables, storage and balancing for variable sources,
						and environmental or social safeguards for large infrastructure projects.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="nonconventional" class="panel">
					<h2>Why are they called non-conventional?</h2>
					<p>
						The phrase "non-conventional" stems from the historical dominance of large,
						centralized power plants using fossil fuels. When alternatives such as small
						hydro systems, rooftop solar arrays, and community wind projects emerged, they
						operated under different technical and commercial models and so were labelled
						"non-conventional." Over time the term evolved into "renewable energy," but
						the historical distinction remains useful to describe differences in planning
						and operation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Several factors explain why non-conventional technologies grew in importance.
						First, environmental concerns about air pollution and climate change created a
						strong policy incentive to reduce emissions. Second, technological advances and
						manufacturing scale reduced costs for solar panels and wind turbines, making
						them economically competitive. Third, new business models and policy tools
						(feed-in tariffs, auctions and net metering) provided predictable revenue
						streams for developers and homeowners.
					</p>
					<p>
						Non-conventional sources also change how systems are engineered: they introduce
						variability, decentralization and more actors (households, communities,
						aggregators). Engineering responses include better short-term forecasting,
						storage solutions, network reinforcements and market designs that reward
						flexibility. Social and environmental assessments — for siting, biodiversity
						and community benefits — are important to ensure sustainable deployment.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, the rise of non-conventional technologies reflects a combination of
						policy choices, technological progress and different societal priorities — and
						these sources are now central to meeting climate and access goals worldwide.
					</p>

				<section id="scenarios" class="panel">
					<h2>Current Energy Scenarios  World &amp; India</h2>
					<p>
						The global energy landscape in the 2020s is defined by rapid growth in
						renewables, falling costs for solar PV and wind, and accelerating investment
						in storage technologies. Policymakers and investors are focused on pathways
						that meet climate goals while ensuring affordable and reliable energy for
						consumers.
					</p>
					<p>
						At a global level, deployment of utility-scale solar and wind has outpaced
						many expectations, driven by improved supply chains, competitive auctions
						and corporate procurement. However, the transition also requires retiring or
						repurposing existing fossil assets, expanding transmission and distribution
						capacity, and investing in both short- and long-duration storage solutions to
						manage seasonal variations.
					</p>
					<p>
						India's energy system is one of the most dynamic. Rapid urbanization and
						industrialization are increasing electricity demand, while policy targets and
						auctions have driven sharp growth in solar and wind capacity. The country is
						also exploring large-scale storage and regional grid integration to balance
						variable generation. Energy access initiatives are reducing dependence on
						traditional biomass for cooking and improving reliability in rural areas.
					</p>
					<p>
						Key elements of future scenarios include technology costs, policy ambition,
						and financing availability. High-renewable scenarios assume aggressive
						deployment of solar and wind combined with storage and demand flexibility,
						while more conservative scenarios rely on a mix including gas and some firm
						low-carbon generation to manage reliability. The right mix depends on local
						resources, grids and policy choices.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="solar" class="panel">
					<h2>Solar Energy</h2>
					<p>
						Solar energy converts the sun's electromagnetic radiation into electricity or
						heat. Photovoltaic (PV) panels use semiconductor junctions to generate
						current when exposed to light, while concentrated solar power (CSP)
						employs mirrors to focus sunlight and produce heat that drives turbines. The
						remarkable decline in PV and inverter costs over the past decade has made
						solar one of the lowest-cost options for new electricity in many regions.

						<div>
							<h3>Solar Radiation</h3>
							<p>
								The amount of solar energy available at a given site depends on latitude,
								season, cloud cover and atmospheric conditions. Resource assessment uses
								historical satellite data and ground measurements to estimate annual
								insolation and expected yield for specific panel technologies and tilt
								angles.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						Solar is especially powerful because it scales across applications: rooftop
						PV empowers individual households and businesses; community-scale systems
						support neighborhoods; and utility-scale farms generate bulk power. Pairing
						solar with battery storage extends its usefulness into evening and peak
						hours, and smart inverters provide grid services such as voltage support and
						frequency response.
					</p>
					<p>
						Policy instruments (subsidies, auctions, net metering) and corporate
						procurement have accelerated deployment. Challenges include land use for
						very large farms, recycling of end-of-life panels, and ensuring equitable
						access to benefits. Research into perovskites, tandem cells and improved
						manufacturing promises continued efficiency and cost improvements.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="wind" class="panel">
					<h2>Wind Energy</h2>
					<p>
						Wind energy harnesses the kinetic power of moving air to generate electricity
						via rotor blades and generators. Modern utility turbines are highly engineered
						machines optimized for high capacity factors and low maintenance. Site choice,
						hub height and rotor diameter are critical for capturing steady winds and
						maximizing energy production.
					</p>
					<p>
						Onshore wind remains one of the lowest-cost sources of new electricity in many
						regions. Offshore wind, with stronger and more consistent winds, is growing
						rapidly — especially with the advent of large turbines and floating
						foundations that open deep-water sites. Modern projects combine advanced
						resource assessment, digital monitoring and predictive maintenance to improve
						performance and reduce downtime.
					</p>
					<p>
						Challenges include integration into grids at high penetration levels, potential
						local environmental impacts (birds, visual/noise concerns), and the need for
						transmission upgrades to connect high-resource sites to demand centers. As
						technology continues to advance, repowering older sites with larger, more
						efficient turbines can deliver significantly higher yields with the same
						footprint.
